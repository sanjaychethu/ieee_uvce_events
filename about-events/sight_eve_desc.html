        <p class="post-text">As part of the IEEE UVCE Silver Jubilee Celebration, a School Adoption Program is being organized monthly by IEEE UVCE SIGHT, with different SIGs conducting sessions. This month, IEEE UVCE WIE led the program, focusing on teaching science and linking academic concepts with practical applications.</p>
         <p class="post-text">Students from grades 6 and 7 participated in an interactive session on magnetism. Hands-on activities and group exercises made learning engaging and relatable, and the student's enthusiasm added energy to the session.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">Despite time constraints and varying learning speeds, the program successfully enhanced the student's understanding and curiosity. Interactive questions were asked during the session, with goodies awarded to top-performing students. The initiative emphasized the importance of accessible and enjoyable learning.
