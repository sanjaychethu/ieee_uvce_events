            <h2>Voltorb - July 2024</h2>
    
            <p class="post-text">Voltorb is a monthly contest where a given problem statement has to be solved by building a feasible solution in the form of an electronic circuit, either by simulation or a physical circuit.
                <br>

                For this month's Voltorb, participants were asked to develop a Smart Pet Feeder incorporating IR sensors to detect a pet's presence and automatically dispense food. They were asked to devise a method for portion control and scheduled feeding, and include an LCD for real-time monitoring. <br>
