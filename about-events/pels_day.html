        <p class="post-text">IEEE UVCE PELS chapter hosted a PELS Day webinar with Ms. Rinika Paul. Her talk explored the fundamentals of Power Electronics, showcasing its role in miniaturizing devices (like those with Taiwan Semiconductors' 1.6nm tech). Different semiconductor devices were discussed, including the rising star Gallium Nitride (GaN).</p>
         <p class="post-text">The webinar went beyond the basics. It explored Power Electronics applications from USB-C cables to AI and offered a positive outlook for the field ("no recession"). Looking ahead, Ms. Paul discussed how Power Electronics will integrate with IoT (e.g., controlling AUVs). She even addressed exciting career opportunities, highlighting GaN and offering job-hunting advice.
        </p>
