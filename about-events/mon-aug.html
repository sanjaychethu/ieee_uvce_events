        <h2>NCode - August 2024</h2>
    
            <p class="post-text">
                NCode August 2024 was based on the theme - The Olympics! ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰ <br>

The participants were given 4 problems of increasing difficulty, 1 easy, 2 medium and 1 hard. The problems were based on data structures and mathematics. In 4 hours, contenders competed to solve these questions as fast as they could, to grab the maximum points! <br>
The winners are: <br>
1. Kannika K R - ECE, 2nd Year <br>
2. Krishna L - AIML, 2nd Year <br>
3. S R Abhilash - ECE, 2nd Year <br>

            <h2>Voltorb - August 2024</h2>
    
            <p class="post-text">Voltorb is a monthly contest where a given problem statement has to be solved by building a feasible solution in the form of an electronic circuit, either by simulation or a physical circuit.

                <br>

                For this month's Voltorb, participants were asked to develop an automated system using Arduino for managing irrigation and pest control. The system should be able to use real-time data to optimize water usage, reduce pesticide use, and promote sustainable crop growth.
